Problem 1. (30 points)

 True/False questions (3 points each)

a) Liang-Barsky algorithm may clip a line four times in the worst case.
   FALSE. That would be the Cohen-Sunderland (lecture 5)

b) In OpenGL, the view-volumes for perspective projection, that the user can
   define, are always symmetric with respect to the direction of projection
   (DOP). 

c) In Cabinet projection, lines perpendicular to the projection plane (VP) get
   projected with no change in their lengths, i.e. the length of the projection
    of a line will be equal to the length of the line.

d) Cohen-Sutherland algorithm runs faster than Liang-Barsky algorithm if
   several lines could be trivially rejected, and accepted. TRUE (lecture 5)

e) A point light source illuminates the scene from only one direction. FALSE. That is the definition of a 
  "Infinitely Distant Light Source". (pg. 509 and lecture 9) 


f) We can not obtain a 3-point (3 vanishing points) projection from a projection
   plane (VP) that intersects only two principal axes. TRUE. In general, number of principal vanishing points
   equals the number of principal axes cut by the viewing plane. (lecture 8)


g) A Lambertian surface reflects equal amount (intensity) of light in all
   directions. TRUE. (pg. 514)

h) Standard OpenGL position of the camera is (0, 0, 0) in world coordinates,
   looking in +Z direction, with up vector (0, 1, 0). FALSE. It would be looking on the -Z direction (lecture 8)

i) A view volume is the 3D correspondent of a 2D clipping window. TRUE (pg. 311)


j) In axonometric projections, parallelism of lines is preserved but angles are not. TRUE (pg. 317 and lecture 8)



Problem 2. (35 points)

Geometrical Modeling

Jimmy Neutron wants to model an airplane consisting of a body and two wings,
as shown below. The body has length 10 units, both the wings have lengths 5
units each, the two wings make a 60 degrees angle with the trunk, and both the
wings are attached to the trunk at distance 7 units from its bottom. The
bottom of the body is at the origin (0, 0) of the 2D World Coordinate System,
and the body is placed vertically (i.e. along the y-axis).


Jimmy Neutron wrote the following piece of OpenGL code to model the airplane.
Will this code correctly model the airplane? If not, then:

* (15 points) briefly explain why not

	Jimmy’s code does not draw the plane correctly. Breaking down the code 
	we get the following things wrong:
	
	   1. Drawing the body of the plane. The first point of the line gets 
	      placed at the origin, but the end of the line is at position 
	      10 on the x axis and not in the y. The second vertex call needs 
	      to be glVertex2f( 0, 10 ).

	   2. Drawing each wing should be put in pushMatrix()/popMatrix() 
	      section. That way when he does rotates/translates/scales on one 
	      wing, it doesn’t affect everything else below those calls.

	   3. Both translate calls to move the wings up are wrong. Currently 
	      Jimmy is moving the wings 7 in the x direction, not the y. 
	      The correct translate call should be glTranslatef( 0, 7, 0 ).

	   4. The second roatation call should be greater than 30 degrees.



* (20 points) correct the code so that it models the airplane correctly
glMatrixMode( GL_MODELVIEW )
	glLoadIdentity()

	glBegin( GL_LINES )

	    glVertex2f( 0, 0 )

	    glVertex2f( 0, 10 )

	glEnd()

	glPushMatrix()

	    glTranslatef( 0, 7, 0 )

	    glRotatef( -30, 0, 0, 1 )

	    glBegin( GL_LINES )

	        glVertex2f( 0, 0 )

	        glVertex2f( 0, 5 )

	    glEnd()

	glPopMatrix()

	glPushMatrix()

	    glTranslatef( 0, 7, 0 )

	    glRotatef( 30, 0, 0, 1 )

	    glBegin( GL_LINES )

	        glVertex2f( 0, 0 )

	        glVertex2f( 0, -5 )

	    glEnd()

	glPopMatrix()
	
*****END*******************

glMatrixMode (GL_MODELVIEW); // set the current matrix to ModelView Matrix
glLoadIdentity(); // initialize the current matrix to Identity matrix
glBegin (GL_LINES);
	glVertex2f (0, 0);
	glVertex2f (10, 0);
glEnd ();
glRotatef (-30, 0, 0, 1);
glTranslatef (7, 0, 0);
glBegin (GL_LINES);
	glVertex2f (0, 0);
	glVertex2f (5, 0);
glEnd ();
glRotatef (30, 0, 0, 1);
glTranslatef (7, 0, 0);
glBegin (GL_LINES);
	glVertex2f (0, 0);
	glVertex2f (5, 0);
glEnd ();

Note:
glVertex2f (x, y) places a vertex at the point (x, y).
glRotatef (A, 0, 0, 1) rotates counterclockwise by an angle A (in degrees) around the z-axis
glTranslatef (x, y, z) translates by amounts x, y, and z, along the x-, y-, and z-axes, respectively.




Problem 3. (35 points)

Illumination

Consider a triangle ABC, where the coordinates of A, B, and C, are as follows:
      A(0,0,0), B(2,2,0), and C(2,0,0). Suppose L is a point-light source
      located at the point (1,1,1). Suppose the intensity of light from L
      reaching each of A, B, and C is IL = 10 units. Assume that triangle
      ABC is a Lambertian surface with the Lambertian Reflection Coefficient (Kd)
      as 0.5.

Compute the intensities of reflected lights at A, B, and C, respectively, 
using the illumination model for Lambertian surfaces.

Hint: You can easily calculate the length of segment LA as follows:
|LA| = sqrt ( (xL – xA)2 + (yL – yA)2 + (zL – zA)2 ) = sqrt (3).
Also, the projection point LA of LA on the normal on A, has coordinates (0,0,1) 
(because the x and z coordinates of A are 0 and 0, and the y coordinate of L is 1). 
Hence, the length of segment ALA, |ALA| = 1.

You can now calculate cos of the angle between LA and the normal on A, as ALA / LA.

Problem 1
(35 points)

 Weiler-Atherton 2D clipping

Shown below are a subject-polygon (SP) and a clip-polygon (CP). Also shown are some points, namely, a through y, on the SP.

a) (5 points) Show the clipped SP obtained by clipping it with the CP, using the Weiler-Atherton polygon-clipping algorithm.
b) (15 points) Show the contents of the stack after each “interesting” event. Recall that an interesting event occurs when 
   we hit the CP while traversing the SP, or when we hit the SP, while traversing the CP. Assume that you start traversing 
   the SP in clockwise order at Point a, and the first edge traversed is ab.





Problem 2
(30 points)

Sutherland-Hodgeman 2D clipping

A polygon is usually represented with a vertex list such that its edges connect adjacent vertices in the vertex list. For example, 
the polygon shown below with solid lines is represented as a vertex list V = {a, b, c, d, e, f, g} and its list of edges is 
E = {ab, bc, cd, de, ef, fg, ga}. 

c) (15 points) For the polygon clip rectangle configuration given below (clip rectangle shown by dashed edges), show the 
updated list of edges E and the updated list of vertices V, after each clipping with the left boundary, right boundary, bottom 
boundary, and top boundary, in this order, using Sutherland-Hodgeman polygon-clipping algorithm. Show all your work.

d) (5 points) Show the clipped polygon obtained by clipping it with the clipping window, using the Sutherland-Hodgeman 
polygon-clipping algorithm.

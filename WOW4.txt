Problem 1
(35 points)

Weiler-Atherton 2D clipping

Shown below are a subject-polygon (SP) and a clip-polygon (CP). Also shown are 
some points, namely, a through y, on the SP.


a) (5 points) Show the clipped SP obtained by clipping it with the CP, using 
the Weiler-Atherton polygon-clipping algorithm.


b) (15 points) Show the contents of the stack after each “interesting” event. 
Recall that an interesting event occurs when we hit the CP while traversing 
the SP, or when we hit the SP, while traversing the CP. Assume that you start 
traversing the SP in clockwise order at Point a, and the first edge traversed 
is ab.

1. Interesting event: SP intersects CP at point 'b'
	a. continue on SP.

2. Interesting event: SP intersects CP at point 'c'
    	a. Push 'c';  [c]
	b. continue on CP. 

3. Interesting event: CP intersects SP at point 'e'
	a. Push 'e';  [e, c] 
	b. continue on SP.
	
4. Interesting event: SP intersects CP at point 'f'
	a. Push 'f';  [f,e,c]
	b. continue on CP.
	
	 
5. Interesting event: CP intersects SP at point 'b'
	a. 'b' already visited.
	b. Pop 'f' ;  [e,c]
	c. continue on CP.
	
			
6. Interesting event: CP intersects SP at point 'h'
 	a. continue on SP.
	
	
7. Interesting event: SP intersects CP at point 'i'

	a. Push 'o'; [o,k,i,e,c]
	b. continue on CP.
	
		
13. Interesting event: CP intersects SP at point 'x'
	a. Push 'x'; [x,o,k,i,e,c]
	b. continue on SP.
	
	
14. Interesting event: SP intersects CP at point 'y'
	a. Push 'y'; [y,x,o,k,i,e,c]

17. Stuck (x --> y)
	a. 'y' already visited
	b. Pop 'o'; [k,i,e,c]
	c. continue on SP

19. p --> q

20. Interesting event: SP intersects CP at point 'r'
	a. continue on SP
	b. r --> s
	
21. Interesting event: SP intersects CP at point 't'
	a. Push 't'; [t,k,i,e,c]
	b. continue on CP

	i. 'c' already visited
	



Problem 2

Sutherland-Hodgeman 2D clipping

A polygon is usually represented with a vertex list such that its edges connect
adjacent vertices in the vertex list. For example, the polygon shown below with
solid lines is represented as a vertex list V = {a, b, c, d, e, f, g} and its 
list of edges is E = {ab, bc, cd, de, ef, fg, ga}.

c) (15 points) For the polygon clip rectangle configuration given below (clip 
rectangle shown by dashed edges), show the updated list of edges E and the 
updated list of vertices V, after each clipping with the left boundary, right 
boundary, bottom boundary, and top boundary, in this order, using 
Sutherland-Hodgeman polygon-clipping algorithm. Show all your work.


d) (5 points) Show the clipped polygon obtained by clipping it with the clipping 
window, using the Sutherland-Hodgeman polygon-clipping algorithm.
